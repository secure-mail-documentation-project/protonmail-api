# Unofficial Documentation of the ProtonMail API

Various open source projects make use of the ProtonMail API. Due to the lack of an official API documentation by ProtonMail, their developers generally reverse engineer the ProtonMail API from the open source ProtonMail clients.

The idea of this project is to pool developer resources and maintain a community-edited documentation of the ProtonMail API.

_This project is not endorsed or supported by Proton Technologies AG._


# Quick Start

The documentation is written in [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/specification/) format to allow automatic code generation for client and server applications.

You can find a [user-friendly rendering of the documentation using the Swagger UI here](https://generator.swagger.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/secure-mail-documentation-project/protonmail-api/main/protonmail-api.yaml).

# Contributing

You can use the online [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/secure-mail-documentation-project/protonmail-api/main/protonmail-api.yaml) to edit the documentation and view the changes in real time.

To open a pull request when using the Swagger Editor:
- copy the edited code from Swagger Editor into the clipboard
- find the file `protonmail-api.yaml` on github, e.g. by [clicking here](https://github.com/secure-mail-documentation-project/protonmail-api/blob/main/protonmail-api.yaml)
- click the `Edit this file` button
- paste your edited code from Swagger Editor & create a pull request
